# Snake
A simple console based VB.NET Snake game

Snake is an arcade game that mimics most of the gameplay of the famous [Blockade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockade_%28video_game%29).

When the game starts, you are a snake with a head and a tail measuring 1 unit.  
You must then maneuver the snake to eat the dots that will randomly appear on the screen.  
Each dot you eat will grow your snake’s tail based on its color:
- Gray = 1
- Yellow =2
- Green = 3
- Blue = 4
- Red = 5

You are given a limited amount of time to eat each dot. Those dots that you fail to eat in time will shrink your snake accordingly.  
For example, if you fail to eat a Blue dot, your snake’s tail will shrink by 4 units.
You will loose whenever your snake:

- Hits a wall
- Hits it self
- It’s tail shrinks too much
